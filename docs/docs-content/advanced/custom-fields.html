<h1 id="how-to-add-custom-fields">How to add custom fields</h1>
<p>OptionsKit can be extended through custom field types. If your project requires a custom field you can add your own by registering a global Vue.js component. </p>
<p>All currently available fields within OptionsKit are Vue.js components. Knowledge of javascript and Vue.js is required in order to add your own field types.</p>
<p>It is important that when you register a new component you prefix it&#39;s name with <code>formit</code>. For example, if you&#39;re registering a &quot;number&quot; field. The name of the component must be set to <code>formit-number</code>. All components prefixed with <code>formit</code> can be used by OptionsKit.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-formit-">What&#39;s formit?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alessandrotesoro/vue-formit">Formit</a> is a custom javascript Form class that&#39;s been created to work with OptionsKit. An extension of formit has also been created, the extension adds support for basic form fields like text, textareas, dropdowns, etc. The extension is called <a href="https://github.com/alessandrotesoro/vue-formit-fields">Formit-fields</a>. </p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in creation custom fields, it is recommended that you have a look at Formit and Formit Fields first to understand how they work.</p>

<p>Documentation on how to create custom fields will be available soon. Meanwhile you can have a look at OptionsKit source code.</p>
<p>OptionsKit includes 2 custom fields that make use of the Formit-Fields library. The <code>multiselect</code> and <code>file</code> field types are in fact custom fields. </p>
<p>A good starting point to understand how to create custom fields can be found by reading OptionsKit source code here <a href="https://github.com/alessandrotesoro/wp-optionskit/tree/master/src/components/fields">https://github.com/alessandrotesoro/wp-optionskit/tree/master/src/components/fields</a></p>
